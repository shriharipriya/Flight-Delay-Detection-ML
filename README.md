This project focuses on leveraging Machine Learning techniques to predict flight arrival delays, by utilizing a comprehensive dataset comprising weather and flight-related information across 15 airports in the USA.

A pipeline containing a classifier to predict if there is an arrival delay or not, and a regressor to predict the period of delay is implemented and analysed.

Different classification and regression models are trained on the data and the model that performs the best is considered.

The F1 score of the classifier and the R2 score of the regressor were observed to be 0.85 and 0.81 respectively.
